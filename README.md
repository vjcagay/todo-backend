# Todo Backend

This project aims to create todo app implementations demonstrating basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on several backend programming languages.

- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Go
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] C/C++
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] Python

...and many more in the future.

The app, no matter the backend, will connect only into a single MongoDB database.

This project is inspired from [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com) but instead of implementing a todo app with several MV\* frameworks this will only focus on a single frontend with several implementations in the backend.
