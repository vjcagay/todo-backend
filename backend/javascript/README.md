# Todo-Backend in JavaScript (Node.js)

This assumes that Node.js is installed in your system. This also uses NPM for dependency management.

## Setup

- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Make sure that `static` folder is copied. Go to [frontend](../../frontend/README.md) for instructions.
- Run `npm start` to start the server.
- You can also run `npm run dev` to enable auto-reload when developing. You must have `nodemon` installed either locally or globally.
