# Todo-Backend in Java (Spring Boot)

This assumes that Java (Oracle or OpenJDK) is installed in your system. This also uses Gradle for dependency management.

## Setup

- Make sure that `static` folder is copied. Go to [frontend](../../frontend/README.md) for instructions.
- Run `./gradlew bootRun` to install the dependencies and start the server.
